      <p id="internet"> <br><br><br>Hello, I'm Kenneth Bitzer. I grew up in Northern Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Superior. I lived in there for 18 years of my life. I moved to Duluth Minnesota and started working at the 'Whole Foods Co-Op'.  In 2011 I started school at the University of Duluth Minnesota.  I began my studies studying geological sciences. </p>

      <p>I graduated in 2015 with a BS in geology, I continued working in Duluth as a manager on duty for the 'Whole Foods Co-Op'.    I then decided to move to Minneapolis Minnesota in the fall of 2016 and started looking for a job more inline with my major. August of 2016 I took a job as a field chemist.</p>

        <p>I have worked as a field chemist for the past 2 years.  I am currently seeking an education and a job in web development. I enjoy talking about anything geology or astronomy related.  I'm also kind of a gamer nerd.  I built my own PC and play a lot of video games when I have the time.</p>
