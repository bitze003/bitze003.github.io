                Hello, I'm Kenneth Bitzer. I grew up in Northern Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Superior. I lived
               there for 18 years. I moved to Duluth Minnesota and started working at the 'Whole Foods
                Co-Op'. In 2011 I started school at the University of Minnesota Duluth. I began my studies studying
                geological sciences. </p>
<!-- 
            <p>I graduated in 2015 with a Bachleor's of Science in Geology. I continued working in Duluth as a manager for the
                'Whole Foods Co-Op'. I then decided to move to Minneapolis Minnesota in the fall of 2016 and started
                looking for a job more associated with my major. In August of 2016 I took a job as a Field Chemist.</p>

            <p>I have worked as a field chemist for the past 2 years. I am currently seeking an education and a job
                in web development.  I am now enrolled in the Trilogy Bootcamp, taught through the University 
                of Minneosota Twin Cities.  Included on my profile page are some of the projects I have been working on
                while enrolled in the class. </p> -->
                <p>I have lead and managed over 25 people while attending college and getting a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology. 
                I am currently enrolled in the Trilogy web developer bootcamp taught by the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I was 
                recently promoted to project manager position for Carver County Environmental Center overseeing all chemical operations. </p>
                
               <p> Schooling has honed my problem solving skills; being a manager has aided in my communication and customer service skills. 
                I excel in high stress and complex situations. Good communication and problem solving have been key to my success. I have 
                a large interest in new technology and science.The versatility of web development and the large complex problems that can 
                be solved through back-end programming has made me want to pursue this new career.</p>
